# Introduction
The update frequency of MPC significantly influences the control performance for quadruped locomotion. In this controller, we utilize three numerical techniques to accelerate the solving procedure. In our experiments, these techniques can significantly improve the solving frequency, especially when the problem is large (i.e. the predictive horizon is longer or the contacted legs are more).
